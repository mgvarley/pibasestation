# Raspberry PI AIS Base Station

This project contains the configuration and code for deploying an AIS
receiver based on a Raspberry Pi for monitoring shipping movements.  Data is
forwarded to <http://aishub.net> for use in open mapping applications.  
Deployment is via <http://resin.io> and the streams are routed via a small
server running on Digital Ocean which provides a static IP necessary for
authenticating to <http://aishub.net>
